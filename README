Xmonad & Xmobar Configs! 

So! You have found where I stash my xmonad and xmobar configs. Good for you!

These are my custom yet simple configs and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do, 
though I am editing them as I go learning haskell and such so keep tuned if you want
the most upto-date configs! (I am slow so...it takes time).

If you like the configs I suggest to install the Inconsolata font to make them work properly, 
mainly for the xmobar config. I love that font as it is the easiest on my eyes. 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I am not responsible for breaking your computer/screen/window manager.

I will include some helpful comments into the configs so you may work around them easier. 

Thanks again!
